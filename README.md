# Vulnerability Data Archive Tools

This is our attempt at providing a simple means of interacting with the [CERT Vulnerability Data Archive](https://github.com/CERTCC/Vulnerability-Data-Archive). At this time we have no plans to provide any full-fledged applications. Instead we are offering a simple `VulDb()` Python class that can load the vulnerability data contained in the archive. It's up to you to decide how to use it. Anyone with some basic Python skills should be able to make use of this package.

# Getting Started

## Install Prerequisites
Get virtualenv if you don't already have it

```
$ pip install virtualenv
```

Get the Vulnerability Data Archive Tools:

```
git clone https://github.com/CERTCC/Vulnerability-Data-Archive-Tools.git
```

So we'll assume that you now have the code in `./Vulnerability-Data-Archive-Tools`

## Set Up Your Environment

Change into the directory with the code:

```
cd ./Vulnerability-Data-Archive-Tools/src
```

Create a virtualenv:

```
$ cd Vulnerability-Data-Archive-Tools
$ virtualenv vuldata_demo_env
New python executable in cert_vuldata/bin/python
Installing setuptools, pip, wheel...done.
```

Activate it:

```
$ . vuldata_demo_env/bin/activate
```

Install requirements:

```
(vuldata_demo_env)$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install the CERT Vulnerability Data Archive Tools package:

```
(vuldata_demo_env)$ python setup.py install
```

## Get the Data

You can clone the Vulnerability Data Archive using git:

```
git clone https://github.com/CERTCC/Vulnerability-Data-Archive.git
```

Or just download and unzip this:

<https://github.com/CERTCC/Vulnerability-Data-Archive/archive/master.zip>


# Using the Tools

Try the demo:

```
$ cert_vuldata_demo --help
usage: cert_vuldata_demo [-h] datapath

positional arguments:
  datapath    path to CERT Vulnerability Data Archive

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
```

Ok, so you have to point it at the data:

```
(vuldata_demo_env)$ cert_vuldata_demo Vulnerability-Data-Archive/data
```

Watch it go...the demo prints a series of reports just to show you what you can do with this data:

1. a count of the vul records read
2. a list of all records for which "Google" appears as an affected vendor
3. a count of vulnerability reports created by year
4. the number of CVE IDs associated with vulnerability reports

```

# Build Your Own Awesome

This is where your creativity comes in. Want to see all the vuls we cataloged with prime numbered CVEs? How about counting how many times we've said "We are currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem."? You've got ideas for analysis and questions to answer. That's why you're reading this. So to get started, you can follow the examples in `cert_vuldata/demo.py`, or just start with something like

    from cert_vuldata.vuldb import VulDb
    
    vulrecords = VulDb('Vulnerability-Archive-Data/data')
    vulrecords.load()
    
    # a VulDb object is basically a dict
    for vu_id, record in vulrecords.iteritems():
        do_something_with(record)
